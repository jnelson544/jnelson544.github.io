<header> A little about me....</header>

<h1> I was born in a tiny mining town in southern Montana. I graduated high school in 2006 and was not ready for
    college. After bouncing around for four years and trying out several jobs, I decided to begin college for an
    Associates Degree in Pschology.
    After one year, I knew that was not the right fit for me, so I left school. Several years later, I discovered my
    hidden passion for computers while working as a slot machine technician
    outside of Missoula. It was then I decided to enroll at The University of Montana and recieve my bachelors
    degree in
    Computer Science as a
    Software Engineer.</h1>
